This is NOT a good PowerShell module and is not well documented. I would point people to [AutomateAPI](https://github.com/gavsto/AutomateAPI).
There were some things in AutomateAPI that I was not able to do, like update EDFs or return native PowerShell objects from commands, so I built out in this module.
I've spent time beteween 2019 to 2023 working on this module (on and off) which is why it includes things like `+=` (sorry).
Now, I don't use Automate anymore so I won't be working on this anymore.
